# Machines Against Cards Against Humanity
#### Cornell CS 4701 Project
##### By Kaushik and Teddy

Our project is to create an optimal Cards Against Humanity player that will be able to choose a winning card in every round. The player will achieve this by tailoring his choice of card to the judge's (initially unknown) preferences, regardless of which judge is playing.

Results of project shown [here](http://cah.alphasigcornell.org/graph/).
